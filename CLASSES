The class structure of the project is described here

World: the whole world
    Chunk: a big 3d cube on which world is divided. May be obsolette
        Block: a single block in the chunk. 3D cube.
            Material: a physical|graphical model of material in a block
                MaterialEarth
                MaterialStone
            Gase: what fills the insides of block.
                GaseAir
            Temperature: self-described. Maybe obsolette
        Wall: a single wall between blocks in the chunk. 2D square.
            WallOrient: a wall can be LEFT, RIGHT or TOP.
    Biome: a class describing the methods, matherials and such to generate world.
        BiomePlains
        Stratum: a geological structure of a single material family. Used to generate world
(geomorph package)
        Morph: abstract geological movement which mixes stratums and generally makes world pretty
            SlipFault: fault-type morph with vertical movement
                Front: class describing fault itself

    and some stereometry classes. Which better may be moved in a separate package, but I really don't see them being used anywhere else.
